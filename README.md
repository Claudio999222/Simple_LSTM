# LSTM_Model_Training

## Overview

This notebook focuses on training a neural network model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. The primary goal is to demonstrate the application of LSTM layers in building more sophisticated sequential models.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset suitable for a sequential data task, considering both input features and the target variable.

2. **Data Normalization**: Normalize the dataset to ensure standardized input sequences, facilitating effective training.

3. **Model Architecture**: Create a neural network architecture with LSTM layers. Define the structure, including input shape, LSTM layer(s), and output layer.

4. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM model on the prepared dataset. Monitor key training metrics such as loss and accuracy.

5. **Results Visualization**: Visualize the training results, including loss and accuracy curves over epochs. Evaluate the model's performance on a test set.

## Why LSTM?

- **Long-Term Dependency Modeling**: LSTMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them suitable for tasks where understanding context across time steps is crucial.

- **Improved Memory Handling**: LSTMs address the vanishing and exploding gradient problems encountered by traditional RNNs, enabling more effective learning of sequential patterns.

- **Real-world Applications**: LSTMs find applications in diverse domains, including natural language processing, time series prediction, and speech recognition.

This notebook provides a hands-on experience in working with LSTM layers and showcases their effectiveness in modeling sequential data with improved memory handling.
